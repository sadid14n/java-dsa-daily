# ðŸ“… Day 03 - Loops in Java & Basic Problem Solving

## âœ… Topics Covered
- Looping constructs: for, while, do-while
- Practice problems using loops:
    - Generate Arithmetic Progression (AP) and Geometric Progression (GP) up to n terms
    - Check if a number is prime or composite
    - Check if a number is a palindrome
    - Count the number of digits in a number
    - Sum of all digits of a number
    - Generate Fibonacci series up to n terms
    - Print even and odd numbers up to n
    - Print numbers divisible by both 3 and 5
    - Print multiplication table of a number

## ðŸ§  Summary
Today I dived into loops in Java and applied them to solve a variety of foundational problems. These exercises helped solidify my understanding of iteration and control flowâ€”critical building blocks for solving real-world DSA problems efficiently.
