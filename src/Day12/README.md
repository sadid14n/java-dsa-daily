# ðŸ“… Day 12 - Matrix Searching & Zero Setting (LeetCode Problems)

## âœ… Topics Covered

- âœ… *Search in a 2D Matrix* (LeetCode Problem)
    - Matrix rows and columns are sorted
    - Used efficient approach starting from top-right corner (O(m+n) time)

- âœ… *Set Matrix Zeroes* (LeetCode Problem)
    - If an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0
    - Learned both brute-force and optimized in-place approaches using markers

## ðŸ§  Summary

Today I focused on solving two foundational matrix problems from LeetCode.  
These sharpened my ability to reason about row-column patterns and optimize space and time complexity in-place.

These types of problems are frequently asked in coding interviews and help build mastery in *matrix traversal and state manipulation*.
