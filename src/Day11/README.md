# ðŸ“… Day 11 - Matrix Multiplication, Pascalâ€™s Triangle & Leetcode Problem

## âœ… Topics Covered

- âœ… *2D Matrix Multiplication*: Multiply two matrices using nested loops
- âœ… *Pascal's Triangle*: Print first n rows using array logic
- âœ… *LeetCode Problem*: Score After Flipping Matrix
    - Learned how flipping rows and columns can maximize binary matrix row values
    - Practiced greedy techniques and bit manipulation

## ðŸ§  Summary

Today I explored deeper matrix operations like *multiplication* and classic pattern-based questions like *Pascal's Triangle*.  
I also solved a matrix-based *LeetCode problem* that required understanding how matrix manipulation can lead to score maximization.

A great mix of logic, loops, and optimization strategies
