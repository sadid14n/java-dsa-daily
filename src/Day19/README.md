# üìÖ Day 19 - Selection Sort & Insertion Sort

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered

- ‚úÖ *Selection Sort*
    - Learned how to sort by repeatedly finding the minimum element and putting it at the beginning.
    - Time Complexity: O(N^2), Space Complexity: O(1)

- ‚úÖ *Insertion Sort*
    - Learned how to build the sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
    - Time Complexity: O(N^2), but efficient for nearly sorted data.

## ‚úç Problems Solved

- Transform array by marking smallest to largest elements as 0,1,2,...
- Sort an array of strings using Bubble Sort.
- Modified sort to put the kth element at its correct position after each pass.
- Find the *minimum sum of two digits of an array* (like minimizing concatenated pairs).
- Find the *kth smallest element* in an array.

## üß† Summary

Practiced both *Selection Sort* and *Insertion Sort* thoroughly, along with variations and related array problems.  
This strengthens my fundamentals in sorting which will be crucial for optimizing more complex problems later.
