# ðŸ“… Day 09 - 2D Arrays & Matrix Operations

## âœ… Topics Covered

- âœ… Basics of 2D Arrays: Declaration, Initialization, Traversal
- âœ… Add two 2D arrays
- âœ… Find the *largest element* in a 2D array
- âœ… Store and display *student roll numbers and marks* using a 2D array
- âœ… *Transpose* of a matrix
- âœ… *In-place transformation* to transpose (square matrix)
- âœ… *Rotate matrix* by 90Â° clockwise
- âœ… Find the *sum of all elements* in a matrix

## ðŸ§  Summary

Today was all about mastering the fundamentals of *2D arrays and matrix manipulation*. I worked on core operations like addition, transposition, and rotation, which are crucial in problems involving grids and image processing.

I also learned how to handle structured data (like students' marks and roll numbers) using 2D arrays, helping me better visualize real-world use cases.
