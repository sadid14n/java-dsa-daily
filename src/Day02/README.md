# ðŸ“… Day 02 - Nested If-Else, Ternary Operator & Switch Statements

## âœ… Topics Covered
- Nested if-else statements for multi-branch conditions
- Ternary operator for concise conditional expressions
- switch statements for structured decision-making

## ðŸ§  Summary
On Day 2 of my Java with DSA journey, I explored different ways to handle decision-making in Java. I practiced using nested if-else statements, the ternary operator for shorter logic, and switch statements to write cleaner and more readable code for multi-case scenarios. These are essential control flow tools as I move toward solving more complex problems.
