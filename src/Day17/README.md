# 📅 Day 17 - Time & Space Complexity

## ✅ Topics Covered

- ✅ Time Complexity
    - Understanding how the runtime of algorithms scales with input size.
    - Explored common complexities:
        - O(1): Constant time
        - O(N): Linear time
        - O(log N): Logarithmic time
        - O(N^2): Quadratic time
- ✅ Space Complexity
    - Understanding how additional memory usage grows with input size.

## ✍ What I did today

- Learned the fundamentals of time & space complexity, crucial for analyzing and writing efficient algorithms.
- Practiced multiple time complexity problems to solidify my understanding.

## 📄 Resources & Solved Problems

I created a PDF summarizing and solving various time complexity problems.  
You can view or download it from here:

[📂 Google Drive - Time Complexity Problems PDF](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cJxRXFwxr_hBi8o7ca_otQ3yJlYWq6a7)

This helps me build an intuition for choosing the right algorithmic approach based on constraints.

## 🧠 Summary

Focused purely on the theory and problem-solving aspect of algorithm analysis.  
This will pay off heavily as I move into more advanced DSA problems and competitive programming.
