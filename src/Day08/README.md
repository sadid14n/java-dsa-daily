# ðŸ“… Day 08 - Advanced Array Problems & Interview Patterns

## âœ… Problems Solved

- âœ… Check if an array is a *subset* of another
- âœ… Check if an array is *palindromic*
- âœ… Check if an array is *sorted*
- âœ… Count elements *strictly greater* than a given number x
- âœ… Count the number of *triplets* whose sum equals a target number
- âœ… Difference between sum of *even and odd indices*
- âœ… Find the *unique* element (non-repeating)
- âœ… Find the *duplicate* element(s)
- âœ… Find the *smallest missing positive integer*
- âœ… Find the *first non-repeating element*
- âœ… Find the *three largest elements* in the array
- âœ… *Merge two sorted arrays* into one
- âœ… Find the *next greatest element* for each element
- âœ… Replace:
    - Even indices â†’ +10
    - Odd indices â†’ 2 Ã— index
- âœ… Sort array of 0s, 1s, 2s:
    - Single pass using Dutch National Flag Algorithm
    - Double pass approach

## ðŸ§  Summary
Today I practiced a variety of *real-world and interview-focused array problems. These covered search, frequency, sorting, and element manipulation techniques. Especially enjoyed working with **Dutch National Flag Algorithm, **triplet sum, and **non-repeating element logic*.

Itâ€™s exciting to see how much can be done with just arrays and good logic!
