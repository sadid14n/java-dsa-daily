# ðŸ“… Day 13 - Matrix Operations & Traversals

## âœ… Topics Covered

- âœ… Add two matrices and store result in one of the matrices
- âœ… Find the *largest element* in a 2D matrix
- âœ… Display elements of the *middle row and middle column*
- âœ… Generate an n x n matrix and *fill it in spiral order*
- âœ… Print *both diagonals* of a square matrix
- âœ… Print the *row number with the maximum sum*
- âœ… Rotate the matrix by *90 degrees anti-clockwise*

## ðŸ§  Summary

Today's focus was on *advanced matrix manipulation and traversal*.  
I practiced modifying matrices in-place, generating spiral matrices, and solving common coding challenges such as row/column analysis and rotation.

These problems helped me improve logical thinking around index manipulation and edge cases for square and rectangular matrices.
