# ðŸ“… Day 04 - Java Methods & Pattern Printing

## âœ… Topics Covered
- *Methods in Java*: Defining and calling functions
- Problem-solving using methods:
    - Calculate area of a circle
    - Count number of digits in a number and find their squares
    - Print all odd numbers between two numbers
    - Square of first n natural numbers using a method

- *Pattern Printing* using:
    - * (star) patterns: rectangle, square, right-angled triangle, reverse triangle
    - Number patterns
    - Alphabet patterns

## ðŸ§  Summary
Today was all about writing *modular code using methods* and improving logic through *pattern-based problem-solving*. These exercises helped reinforce function structure and introduced nested loop logicâ€”both essential for clean code and DSA.
