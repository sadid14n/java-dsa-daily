# ðŸ“… Day 10 - Matrix Traversal (Wave & Spiral) + 2D ArrayList

## âœ… Topics Covered

- âœ… Print a 2D matrix in *Wave Form*
- âœ… Print a 2D matrix in *Spiral Order*
- âœ… Learned the *basics of 2D ArrayList* in Java:
    - Declaration & initialization
    - Adding elements
    - Accessing and updating values

## ðŸ§  Summary

Today's focus was on different ways to *traverse a 2D matrix*, especially using wave and spiral patternsâ€”essential techniques in competitive programming.

I also explored *2D ArrayLists*, which offer dynamic sizing and are more flexible than arrays, making them useful for problems where dimensions are unknown or variable.
