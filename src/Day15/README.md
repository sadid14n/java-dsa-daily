    - .delete()
    - .setCharAt()
    - .length(), .capacity()
    - .append()
- âœ… Solved Leetcode problems:
    - Check if two strings are *anagrams*

## ðŸ§  Summary

Todayâ€™s focus was on strengthening my understanding of Javaâ€™s StringBuilder class and solving common string-related problems that are frequently asked in coding interviews.  
Manipulating characters, reversing words, and solving LeetCode problems gave me hands-on experience with optimizing string logic both in-place and via helper methods.
