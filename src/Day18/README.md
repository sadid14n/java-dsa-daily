# üìÖ Day 18 - Bubble Sort

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered

- ‚úÖ *Bubble Sort Algorithm*
    - Learned how Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
    - Discussed optimized Bubble Sort with early exit if no swaps are made in a pass.
    - Time Complexity:
        - Worst & Average: O(N^2)
        - Best Case (already sorted): O(N)
    - Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting)

## ‚úç Problems Solved

- Sort an array of integers in *ascending order* using Bubble Sort.
- *Check if the array is almost sorted* (each element is at most one position away from its correct place).
- Sort an array in *decreasing order* using Bubble Sort.
- Explored edge cases and wrote clean, modular Java methods for each variation.

## üß† Summary

Bubble Sort is simple yet powerful for learning how swaps work.  
Even though it‚Äôs inefficient for large data sets, it‚Äôs a great stepping stone to more advanced sorting algorithms.  
Practicing these variations deepened my understanding of element comparisons, swaps, and loop control.
