# 📅 Day 18 - Bubble Sort

## ✅ Topics Covered

- ✅ *Bubble Sort Algorithm*
    - Learned how Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
    - Analyzed its time and space complexity.
        - Worst & Average Case: O(N^2)
        - Best Case (already sorted): O(N)
        - Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place)

## ✍ What I practiced

- Implemented Bubble Sort on arrays to sort integers in ascending order.
- Added early exit optimization if no swaps are done in a pass (improves best-case performance).

## 🧠 Summary

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms, great for building intuition on sorting and swapping logic.  
Moving forward, I’ll compare it with more efficient algorithms like Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort.
