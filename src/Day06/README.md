## ðŸ§  Summary
Today I worked with *arrays and ArrayLists* in Javaâ€”two essential data structures. I practiced implementing array logic through real-world problems like sorting, Two Sum, and max/min search. I also learned the dynamic nature and flexibility of ArrayLists for more advanced list-based operations.
