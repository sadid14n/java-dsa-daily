# 📅 Day 07 - Array Manipulation: Reversal, Rotation & Sorting

## ✅ Topics Covered
Today I focused on solving practical array problems using efficient techniques such as the *two-pointer method*. Here's what I worked on:

### 🔄 Array Reversal
- Reverse array using an extra array
- Reverse array in-place using two pointers

### 🔁 Rotate Array by K Positions
- Method 1: Using an extra array
- Method 2: In-place rotation using two-pointer logic

### ⚖ Sort Zeros and Ones in an Array
- Method 1: Count 0s and 1s, then overwrite array
- Method 2: In-place sorting using two-pointer technique

## 🧠 Summary
This session strengthened my understanding of *array indexing, memory usage, and pointer techniques*. Solving problems with and without extra space helped me recognize time-space trade-offs—key for DSA interviews.
