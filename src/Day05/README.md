# ğŸ“… Day 05 - Advanced Pattern Printing in Java

## âœ… Topics Covered
Today I focused entirely on solving *advanced pattern printing problems* using nested loops and logic. Here's a list of what I practiced:

### ğŸ”· Star Patterns
- Plus + pattern using *
- Cross X pattern using *
- Flipped triangle and aligned star triangle
- Star pyramid
- Star diamond
- Star bridge
- Star rhombus

### ğŸ”¢ Number Patterns
- Number bridge
- Number spiral
- Number pyramid
- Palindrome pyramid
- Flipped number triangle

### ğŸ”¤ Character Patterns
- Character triangle
- Mixed patterns with stars, numbers, and characters

## ğŸ§  Summary
Pattern printing may look simple at first, but building *composite shapes with nested loops* really tests logic and attention to detail. Todayâ€™s practice pushed me to think in grids, break down structure line by line, and fine-tune formattingâ€”all key for mastering loops and conditions.
